# 2048-Game

2048 is a single-player sliding block puzzle game. The game's objective is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them to create a tile with the number 2048.

2048 is played on a 4Ã—4 grid, with numbered tiles that slide when a player moves them using the four arrow keys or button given on screen. Every turn, a new tile will randomly appear in an empty spot on the board with a value of either 2. Tiles slide as far as possible in the chosen direction until they are stopped by either another tile or the edge of the grid. If two tiles of the same number collide while moving, they will merge into a tile with the total value of the two tiles that collided. The resulting tile cannot merge with another tile again in the same move. Higher-scoring tiles emit a soft glow.

If a move causes three consecutive tiles of the same value to slide together, only the two tiles farthest along the direction of motion will combine. If all four spaces in a row or column are filled with tiles of the same value, a move parallel to that row/column will combine the first two and last two.

The game is won when a tile with a value of 2048 appears on the board, hence the name of the game.
